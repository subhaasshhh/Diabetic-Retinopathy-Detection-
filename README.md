# Diabetic-Retinopathy-Detection.
The Reticence of Ocular Disorder In The Community Has Been a Major Deterrent To One Being Visually Impaired Before Getting Diagnosed. The Genesis Lies Deeper In The Inefficiency of  Ophthalmologists Configuring the Root Cause of Defacement. One Such Predicament Is Diabetic Retinopathy [Caused Due To Changes In Retinal Blood Vessels] Which Is In An Upsurge Causing Apprehension For Vision Loss. Meagre Research Has Been Carried Out Using Different Learning Techniques Giving a Vague Prospect of a Cogent Solution. In This Paper, We Have Subsumed Potent Deep Learning [8-Layer CNN] & Transfer Learning Architectures [MobilenetV2, DenseNet121, InceptionV3, ResNet50, VGG16] For Deducing the Potentiality of a Person Having Diabetic Retinopathy Using a 02-Class Model With Collating Varied Dataset Namely APTOS 2019 & HRF Image Database Begetting Pre-Eminent  Accuracy Results With Metrics Comprehended Such as F1 Score, Area Under Curve, Cohenâ€™s Kappa Score For Corroboration.
